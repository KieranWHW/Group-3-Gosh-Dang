	@ store the current light pattern (binary mask) in R4
	LDR R4, =0b0011010 @ load a pattern for the set of LEDs (every second one is on)

program_loop:

	LDR R0, =GPIOE  @ load the address of the GPIOE register into R0
	STRB R4, [R0, #ODR + 1]   @ store this to the second byte of the ODR (bits 8-15)

	BX LR @ return from function call
